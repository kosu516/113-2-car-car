# 113-2 Car Car Class - Final Project

**Cornerstone EECS Design and Implementation** (often called the **“car car class”**) is a hands-on Automatic Control and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) project course for freshmen. Before midterm, students build an [**Arduino-based line-following robot car**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQf-D_Gr7CqIHoz1Cm66wXQjDqVTB4lPa&si=xx4vN8DQm5auAJbI) and compete by developing algorithms to find the highest-scoring path. For the final project, students freely design and build a unique device using platforms such as Arduino, ESP32, or Raspberry Pi (RPi) with related modules.

For our final project, we built an **interactive wind-instrument practice device**. We moved the instrument’s key layout onto a pair of gloves, allowing users to practice fingerings on a tabletop like playing a piano. A head-mounted airflow sensor simulates breath control and volume, enabling practice anytime, anywhere without the actual instrument.

The device provides **three modes**: **Free Play**, **Fingering Practice**, and **Song Performance**. Fingering Practice guides users step-by-step with LED cues on the glove. Song Performance works like a rhythm game—the LEDs follow the song’s tempo, and users play along to perform the piece.

Finally, our final project received an Honorable Mention in the end-of-semester project competition.
